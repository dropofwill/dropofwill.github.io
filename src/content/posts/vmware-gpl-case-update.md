# VMware GPL case update

In case you haven't heard the SFC is supporting Christoph Hellwig in a lawsuit against VMware ESXi, claiming they aren't releasing work that is derivative of the Linux kernel. The best way to get up to speed is probably the [FAQ on the SFC's website](https://sfconservancy.org/linux-compliance/vmware-lawsuit-faq.html), keeping in mind of course that this is just one side of the story. There are a couple of reasons why this is an interesting case: 1) GPL enforcement cases are, perhaps surprisingly, rare, 2) it deals with a clause in the GPL on derivative work that has yet to be established by any previous litigation, so this case will be precedent setting, and 3) its happening in Germany, which has unique laws surrounding copyright.

So no matter what your opinion on the GPL, you understand that this case is an important one to follow. For personal projects I tend to default to the most open license and use more restrictive ("free") licenses only when I can be convinced that they are worthwhile (which is almost never with the type of work/communities I'm involved with). That said, while I really dislike that the GPL exists (it's a hack, restricts the software commons, wastes money on enforcement), [Mike Linksvayer convinced me that in this case its worthwile to support it](http://gondwanaland.com/mlog/2015/03/05/gpl-lovers-haters-exploiters-enforce/). I highly recommend reading his article, as he is on the SFC board and has some insightful ideas that he admits are pretty controversial even to the SFC.
