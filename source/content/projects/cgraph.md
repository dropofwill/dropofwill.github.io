description: 'A function call graph visualizer for C'
summary: 'C-Graph takes a given Github repo, extracts the C files, and generates a function call graph. It then displays this as a force directed graph on the right and a panel of code on the left. This allows programmers to work their way through a code base as it would be executed (network) instead of how it is written (linear).'
