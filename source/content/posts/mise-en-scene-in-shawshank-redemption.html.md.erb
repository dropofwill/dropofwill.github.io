Shawshank Redemption (1994) is fundamentally a film about dealing with a lack of control. Even from the first sight of director Frank Darabont establish a claustrophobic atmosphere from tightly cropped shots on the bus to the single file walk in the face of jeering crowd of prisoners. But the prison turns out to be more nuanced than our first impression, Shawshank is a microcosm of the outside world with a wide range of physical spaces from the wide open rec yard to the dark confines of the 'hole'. Even so the outside world still exists and a common thread is how the prisoners respond to the idea and reality of the outside, with hope or despair.

For me the scene that epitomizes this conflict the most happens after Andy gets out of his two-months in solitary confinement for pursuing his innocence with the Warden. In the previous scene we see him lying in the fetal position in the darkness staring at the one spot of light in his solitary confinement cell, just as he finds out that he is completely at the mercy of the warden again (maybe even worse than being marched in naked, knowing that he could have been proven an innocent man).

It cuts to him propped up against the wall in the yard covered in a striking triangular darkness. His position is crouched, a similarly defeated position, which parallels the stark line of the shadow cutting though the rec yard. Even though this environment is the polar opposite in terms of physical openness, visually Andy finds himself trapped in the shadow that parallels his own despair.

From out of frame Red walks up from the light. This is sort of the watershed moment of the film for me, up until this point Red has been a father figure to Andy, he has the whole Shawshank system figured out. But as he joins Andy in the darkness and they talk about getting out, he criticizes Andy for his 'shity pipe dreams.' Andy comes back with the ultimatum that his latest experiences have placed him in, 'get busy living, or get busy dying.' As he gets up and walks away, they swap places physically and thematically, from now on he is the mentor and the one with connections to the outside world.
