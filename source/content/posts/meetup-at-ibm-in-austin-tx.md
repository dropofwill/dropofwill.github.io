For this Spring break 6 honors students from GCCIS (the computing school) at RIT visited Austin, TX. We met with 6 local tech companies to learn a little bit about what they do and what its like to work in their company and domain. One of these was IBM, specifically we met with the researchers, engineers, and designers that worked on Watson. As a language science minor this was probably the coolest part of the trip for me personally.

One cool part about visiting Watson Labs was that we got to sit-in on one of their biweekly tech meetups where they bring in someone from outside the lab (but usually within the company) to talk a little bit about some technology they were using or built that might be useful to the team. The week we were there was especially cool because they brought in somebody from another office to talk about the open source iPython notebooks and their work around them.

Basically this guys team was working on a system that made iPython notebooks more enterprise/collaboration ready. Basically they created a Google Docs/Drive like interface that made it easier to distribute and collaborate on a notebook, even for people without Git knowledge. On top of that they made a system that makes it easier to reuse code across notebooks and import IBM specific modules (like hooking it up to Watson). Currently they are working on creating a similar system for Scala/Java.

Unfortunately it sounded like they were only 'open sourcing' it to the IBM community until it was completely 'ready'. It sounded like they wanted to make money off of the cloud infrastructure around it and once that was released they were going to also release the source code so that anyone could setup their own instance.
