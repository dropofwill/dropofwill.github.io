## Red Hat Statement of Position and Our Promise on Software Patents

> **Who:** [Red Hat's Legal Team](http://www.redhat.com/en/about/all-policies-guidelines)
>
> **What:** Red Hat's patent policy and a short article discussing it.
>
> **Where:** [The policy is on Red Hat's website](http://www.redhat.com/legal/patent_policy.html) along with [an article discussing their policy](https://www.redhat.com/magazine/001nov04/features/patents/).
>
> **When:** Copyright 2014


### Good

The Red Hat focus is explicitly to protect all open source efforts, not just their own patents, they will help out smaller downstream projects that could not afford what patent or patent battles in the same way a large corporation like Red Hat can.



## IBM Statement of Non-Assertion of Named Patents Against OSS

> **Who:** IBM's Legal Team
>
> **What:** IBM's patent policy
>
> **Where:** [Available on IBM's website](http://www.ibm.com/ibm/licensing/patents/pledgedpatents.pdf)
>
> **When:** No timestamp


### Good

It's good that they put this in writing, apparently this used to be just a verbal agreement, but they solidified it in writing after Red Hat called them out on that.

### Bad

All good an well in theory, [but what happens when they break their promises](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/04/ibm-breaks-oss-patent-promise-targets-mainframe-emulator/).


## Google's Open Patent Non-Assertion Pledge

> **Who:** Google's Legal Team
>
> **What:**  Google's patent policy
>
> **Where:** [Available on Google's website](https://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/pledge/)
>
> **When:** No timestamp


### Good

It's cool that Google released their policy under a Creative Commons license.

### Bad

It's too bad this doesn't cover all Google software patents, but just the specific ones that they list on the pledged patents page.


## Questions

* How does the change in the way patents are registered effect Red Hat's defensive patent collection? Now that proof you had the idea first no longer stands do they have to actually file for the patents?

## Final Thoughts

Rating 1/10, patents--.
