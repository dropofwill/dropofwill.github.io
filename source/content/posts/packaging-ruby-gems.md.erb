In the Ruby community the most common way to distribute software is in a packaged format cutely named gems (similar to the Python concept of Eggs). This manages dependencies and meta data much like the other packaging platforms, but with Ruby syntax in a file called '#{you_gems_name}.gemspec'. This process is completely automated through the Ruby gems, `gem` (installation/RubyGems.org integration), `bundler` (dependency management and boiler plate code), and `rake` (Ruby make, to streamline the process). So the release process is as simple as updating the metadata (version number, and any changelog, or whatever) and running `rake build`, `rake release`. From there anyone with a working Ruby install and internet connection can simply run `gem install #{your_gem_name}`. They could also take the local gem created by `rake build` and `gem install #{path/to/gem}`.

This makes sense for my `rtasklib` library, because it is really only useful for people who are already using Ruby and are familiar with its conventions. But what about for `task_time`? In an ideal world users wouldn't even have to know that it runs on Ruby. Luckily Fedora has [an extensive guide](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Ruby?rd=Packaging/Ruby) for packaging gems into RPMs. It makes the distinction between gems used as libraries (like `rtasklib`), gems used as applications (like `task_time`), Ruby scripts not in the gem format. The plan is to release both libraries on [RubyGems.org/profiles/dropofwill](https://rubygems.org/profiles/dropofwill) so that they will be internet accessible, as well as a library RPM package for `rtasklib` and an application RPM package for `task_time`.
