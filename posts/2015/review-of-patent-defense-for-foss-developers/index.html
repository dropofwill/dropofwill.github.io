    <h1>Review of Patent Defense for FOSS Developers</h1>
		<p>This is a review of Chapter 4 of the <em>SFLC Legal Primer</em>, <em>Patent Defense for FOSS Developers</em>, inside it describes the anatomy of a patent, how to deal with claims brought against you, and why you, as a FOSS developer, should not bother with patenting your software, even as a protective measure.</p>

<p>Anatomy of a Patent:</p>

<p><strong>1. Title,</strong> which has no legal bearing.</p>

<p><strong>2. 7-digit uniquie identifier and an application identifier.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Abstract,</strong> a short summary that rarely has any impact on the proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>4. Drawings,</strong> in software these are usually just architecture diagrams or flowcharts.</p>

<p><strong>5. Related patent applications,</strong> ‘related’ here can mean a number of things from continuation of old patents to patents that were originally filed jointly that are now separate.</p>

<p><strong>6. Background of the invention,</strong> gives the applcants view of prior art, though often left out for fear it might limit the scope of the patent more than the applicant wants.</p>

<p><strong>7. Summary of the invention,</strong> a summary of the patent (that again should not be considered in a vacuum).</p>

<p><strong>8. Detailed description,</strong> the part of the patent that should give a “person having ordinary skill in the art” the ability to replicate the invention described above without “undue experimentation”.</p>

<p><strong>9. Claims,</strong> this is actually the most important part of the patent, the SFLC actually recommends one read a patent from back to front to make sure you understand what the patent wants before moving on.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are three major ways to handle patent claims brought against you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Show that you were given the rights to use the patent, probably through a FOSS license (especially the Apache license, which explicitly grants this) or royalty free agreement with the patent holder.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Show that you have not infringed on the claimed patent by working your way backwards through the patents claims.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Show that the patent is actually invalid and thus not enforcible.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A good way to understand how to invalidate a patent claim is to understand how it is claimed to be valid in the first place.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under patent law, in order for a patent to be valid, the claimed invention must have been <em>useful</em>, <em>reducible to practice</em>, <em>novel</em>, and <em>non-obvious</em> to a “person having ordinary skill in the art” at the time that the invention was made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve said this before about this book, but I think anything this theoretical needs to be tied down and motivated with some concrete examples, which I’m sure exist later in the book part III, but from what I see in the syllabus we will not be getting to that section in the near future if at all. Maybe I’ll get a chance to review it on my own time and make a post about my findings here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The idea that while you are still liable if you didn’t know of a patents existence, you are held under a stricter set of rules (up to 3 times the original punishment!) if they prove you violated the patent knowingly. That’s completely messed up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The concept of patents as a whole is so messed up right now. I’m not a fan of copyright in general, but at least that is an inclusive IP, patents by their nature require a lot of money to back them and basically set up the playing field for corporations only.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I personally don’t like some of the requirements brought forward by the Apache license (mainly the state changes clause), but it also seems like the only OSI license that includes a patent grant. If I was concerned about something in a code base being patentable, what are my best options besides the Apache license? Should I take out the parts of the Apache that I don’t want (and notify the user that it is a modified license) or add a patent grant to or alongside another permissive license?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why the Creative Commons Zero dedication with license fallback was rejected by the OSI was because of this clause in the limitation’s section:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If deleted, this dedication/license seems like it would have been accepted by the OSI, based on the mailing list discussion, is that a good idea to do in practice? What if I added a patent grant like is in the Apache license? Would that fulfill the goals of the question I raised above?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the text it says:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A patent holder providing code under a FOSS license without an explicit patent license grant, such as GPLv2, would nonetheless probably be held to have granted a license implicitly to recipients of the code, though the scope and coverage of such an implied license would be difficult to establish.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Has this ever been played out in court? How well has the Apache patent grant worked vs. this “implicit” grant from license without a patent grant (GPL, MIT, etc.)?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Very informative on a topic I initially knew almost nothing about. It both scared and reassured me about the state of patent law in the US. In reality probably next to nothing I write as a developer will be patentable, but just that possibility scares me a lot all the same.</p>

<p>I give it <strong>19/20th’s</strong>, just wish it included some examples inline and maybe touched on the international issue a little bit, but this is a big topic and they covered it well in as concise fashion and I respect that.</p>
